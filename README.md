Auto Sun Position (Prototype)

Auto Sun Position is a mod for Cities: Skylines that prevents backlighting during gameplay, improving visibility for construction work.
It features the following:

* A permanently displayed UI allows controlling light direction via a slider
* Automatically rotates light sources (controls longitude) when detecting backlighting exceeding a specified angle
* Speed, timing, and offset of auto-rotation are configurable via options

Compatibility with Theme Mixer 2.5 and Render It has been confirmed.
